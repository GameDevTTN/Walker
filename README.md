How to turn on tracking
------------------
1. Press the start button 
2. To turn on the GPS tracking, Press the GPS button and wait until it says running (GPS feature will ony work on devices which have GPS)
3. Once it says running, there will be a text saying "You have travelled x metres in the last y minutes. Your average speed is z m/s.
   (If the text in the GPS button does not change to running, it means that it is still calibrating its location)  
4. If there is no text saying in step 3, then the GPS is still calibrating its location. You just have to wait.
